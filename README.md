# llmparse
LLMParse is an open-source Python script developed by DiscordDigital that generates questions from a given text input and runs them through a benchmark to evaluate the performance of an LLM (Language Learning Model). It can be used to obtain a question-and-answer based chat history for your LLMs, resulting in more precise responses.
